      <p>I have been on a computer/console my entire life. Not only have I been curious about how our world works, but I've also had a fascination with how computers work. Some examples would be:</p>
      <ul>
        <strong>
          <li>What makes a key on a keyboard function? (in games/typing etc...)</li>
          <li>What is happening in the background when I click on a button on a website?</li>
          <li>How do all of these computer parts work together to get THIS?</li>
        </strong>
      </ul>
      <p>Ever since I got into coding, I've thoroughly enjoyed the learning process and love thinking about all of the paths this road will take me!</p>
